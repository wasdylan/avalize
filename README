Avalize is file sharing made simple. Warning: extremely new, still under development, and by no means secure.

INSTALLATION:
1. Download Avalize source and make sure your Python isn't a problematic bitch.
2. Get EasyGui. (Debianers like me: sudo apt-get python-easygui).
3. Configure Avalize database (python ./talk.py config).
4. Run the server (python ./listen.py).
5. Run the talker to do shit.

CONCEPT:
The idea behind Avalize: each computer on a network has a public list of publically available files. Computers can ping each other for this list, identify the files they want from it, and download those files.


CURRENT USAGE:
Make a file available:
python ./talk.py list [local file path]

Un-availabalize a file: 
python ./talk.py unlist [id, partial-full path or filename]

See your current public list: 
python ./talk.py mylist

See another's list: 
python ./talk.py getlist [target ip]

Get a file from another's list: 
python ./talk.py getfile [target ip] [id, partial-full path or filename to get from their list]

Send a file to a specific host without avalizing it (manual transmission): 
python ./talk.py sendfile [recipient ip] [local file to send]


FORTHCOMING:
Debianize, installable by humans.
