Avalize is file sharing made simple.

Warning: extremely new, still under development, and by no means secure.

INSTALLATION:
1. Download source and make sure you Python is behaving.
2. Get EasyGui. (Debianers like me: sudo apt-get easygui).
3. Configure Avalize database (python ./db-config.py).
4. Run the server (python ./listen.py).
5. Run the talker to do shit.

CURRENT USAGE:
The idea behind Avalize: each computer on a network has a public list of publically available files. Computers can ping each other for this list, identify the files they want from it, and download those files.

Make a file available: python ./talk.py avalize ~/documents/file.pdf
Get a list of another's public files: python ./talk.py getlist [target ip]
Send a file to a specific host without avalizing it (manual transmission): python ./talk.py sendfile [recipient ip] ~/documents/file.pdf

FORTHCOMING:
Devalizing files (priority).
Ability to make list available only to trusted hosts on network.
Encrypt data transmissions.
Get lists from all trusted hosts at once.
Specify files to download by id, full path, or even partial path / filename.
Debianize, installable by humans.
