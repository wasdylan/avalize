GENERAL:
Avalize is ideal for networks with multiple computers that frequently require files from each other. Each host on a network with avalize installed has a public list of publically available (avalized) files. Hosts can ping each other for this list, and download the files available through it without having to wait for authentication. Warning: avalize is extremely new, still under development, and by no means secure. Only use on a network with trusted hosts.


DEPENDENCIES:
python (apt-get install python) and easygui (apt-get install python-easygui).


INSTALLATION:
via the .deb package.


CURRENT USAGE:
Start you avalize server:
avalize server

Make a file available:
avalize list [local file path]

Un-availabalize a file: 
avalize unlist [id, partial-full path or filename]

See your current public list: 
avalize mylist

See another's list: 
avalize getlist [target ip]

Get a file from another's list: 
avalize getfile [target ip] [id, partial-full path or filename to get from their list]

Send a file to a specific host without avalizing it (manual transmission): 
avalize sendfile [recipient ip] [local file to send]


FORTHCOMING:
Ability to avalize entire directories.
Ability to get lists from all hosts on a network running avalize at once.
